# 4-Axis Motorized Camera Tracking Rig

Version 2 is currently in progress (UI firmware is finished)! KiCAD files are for an old version, may be incomplete. This project implements a compact, precision **4-axis camera motion platform** for smooth cinematic movement, integrating custom electronics, embedded firmware, and low-backlash mechanical design.
